Shash
==========

At the moment a lot of music is shared on Twitter and Instagram as hash-tags. This way of sharing a moment does not provide optimal UX in terms of actually listening to music. You simply can't!

Shash-tags is an extension to hash-tags, it enables users to deterministically, with the assistance of a typeahead, share music within social media such as Instagram and Twitter. The tag is human-readable and you can see it's a playable song or artist.

The scheme is really simple, just prepend a $-sign in front of any hashtag to make it a sound-tag. For a neater view the $# is replaced with a UTF-8 note-sign(â™«). The full experience requires a client library for "Listen with"-functionality.
